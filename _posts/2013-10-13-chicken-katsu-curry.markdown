This is the Chicken Katsu Curry recipe lifted off of the BBC Good Food website before it was removed (if someone has the Author's details, I'll add here). It's a brilliant recipe that always turns out well for me, hence I'm posting it here for reference.

### Ingredients

---
#### Chicken
* seasoned flour, for dusting
* 1 egg, beaten
* 100g natural dried breadcrumbs (if you can get the Japanese panko breadcrumbs then use those!)
* 4 large skinless, boneless chicken thighs

#### Curry Sauce
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* a small chunk ginger, peeled and finely chopped
* a pinch chilli flakes (optional)
* oil, for frying
* 1 tbsp plain flour, mixed with 1 tbsp mild curry powder
* 350ml chicken stock
* 1 tsp brown sugar (any kind will do)

#### Rice
* 100g basmati rice
* 75g frozen peas
* sesame oil
* soy sauce

### Method

1. Put the flour, egg and breadcrumbs in separate dishes. Dust the chicken in flour, then the egg, then breadcrumbs. Chill for 20 minutes.

2. To make the curry sauce cook the onion, garlic and ginger (and chilli flakes if using) in a little splash of oil until softened. Add the flour and curry powder mix, and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring to stop it catching. Slowly add the chicken stock then stir in the sugar and simmer for 15 minutes. Blend the sauce to smooth using a stick blender or food processor.

3. Heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a non-stick
frying pan. Fry the chicken until golden on both sides then transfer to a rack and finish cooking in the oven for 20 minutes.

4. Boil the rice in lots of salted water, adding the peas for the last 2
minutes of cooking. Drain well then toss with a couple of drops of sesame oil and soy.

5. Slice the chicken and arrange on top of the rice then serve with a drizzle of the reheated sauce.
