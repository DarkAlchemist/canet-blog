One thing to note is that I did not come up with this recipe myself but it was sent to me by a friend a long time ago who found it in a magazine or something...

### Ingredients

---
#### Cake

* 225g Dark Chocolate
* 225g unsalted butter
* 345g Fairtrade caster sugar
* 6 free range eggs, separated into yolks and whites
* 120g ground almonds
* 145g soft white breadcrumbs (I ended up with 200gr of ground almonds from tescos so I used the remaining 80gr of almonds and no breadcrumbs)
* 30g plain flour
* 2tbsp vanilla essence

#### Icing

* 85g Cocoa Powder
* 255g Fairtrade icing sugar
* 130g butter
* 170g Fairtrade caster sugar
* 6 tablespoons water (I found I needed to use slightly more water to get a better consistancy to work with, about 2-3 more tbsp)

### Method

---

1. Firstly, preheat the oven to 160Âºc / gas 3. To make the cake, melt Dark Chocolate in a double boiler, or in a bowl placed over a pan of boiling water. 

2. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and the sugar until white and soft. 

3. Add the egg yolks gradually, one by one, then add the almonds and beat them in. 

4. After this, gently fold in the chocolate with a spoon, then add the bread crumbs, flour and vanilla essence and mix together. 

5. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites, along with a pinch of sugar, until stiff - but do not over beat. Fold the egg whites into the cake mixture and then pour the mixture into you buttered cake tin (lined with paper). Place in the oven and cook for 1 hour.

6. During this time make the icing. Place the Cocoa Powder and the icing sugar in a mixing bowl. Then warm together the butter, sugar and water until dissolved. Add the liquid into the dry mixture and mix together for a thick but *pourable* consistency. Once the cake has cooked and cooled, pour over the cake.
