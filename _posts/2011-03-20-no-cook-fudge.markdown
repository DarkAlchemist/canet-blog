### Ingredients

---

* 75gr Unsalted Butter
* 4tbsp Condensed Milk
* 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extra
* 400gr Icing Sugar
* 25gr Cocoa Powder

### Method

---

1. Put the butter, condensed milk and vanilla extract into a bowl and beat together until smooth. Sift the icing sugar and cocoa powder together then gradually mix into the butter. Eventually you will have to use your hands and work the mixture well until it comes together into a firm ball.

2. Lightly dust the work surface with icing sugar, place the fudge ball onto the surface and roll evenly about 1.5cm inch thick.

3. Leave to dry overnight before serving or packing into pretty boxes if you want to give them as a gift.

I must say, it's very, very, VERY sugary but very nice. One thing I noticed by adding a bit too much butter is that it becomes softer.
